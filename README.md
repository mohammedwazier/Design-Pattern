```
Everyday is Learning Day
```

## Motivation

```
Motivation to make this Repository is to Archive my learning About Design Pattern, since my first day of the job about Programmer, i never learn about Design pattern, i hope i can understand about Design Pattern.
```

## Problem

```
The Problem is, in my college i was never learn about Design Pattern, because the Major i took is not to learn about Software Engineering.
